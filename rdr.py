    of a set of mutually exclusive conclusions. Whenever a conclusion is made, the classification restarts from the

    continues until no more rules can be fired. In addition, previous conclusions can be used as conditions or input to
    the next classification/cycle.
    Another possible mode is to have rules that are considered final, when fired, inference will not be restarted,
     and only a refinement can be made to the final rule, those can also be used in another SCRDR of their own that
     gets called when the final rule fires.
